You are a fearless adventurer.
Your quest is to dive in the
depth of the Dungeon to find the
Artefact of Power of Yendor.

The game progresses with a
system of cards. Pick cards to
go forward, you will face
enemies to fight, objects to
equip or use and more.

To go through the levels, you
need to find a floor card. As
soon as this card is found, you
can choose to go forward, or
stay a bit longer in the current
floor.  Be careful to not be too
eager and go down too fast, or
you might face dangers beyond
your reach.
